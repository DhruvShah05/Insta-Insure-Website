1. **Plan Types**: Floater and Individual plans
2. **Member Management**: 
   - Dynamic add/remove members
   - Individual sum insured per member
   - Individual bonus per member
3. **Database Storage**:
   - `health_insurance_details` table for plan type

   - Furniture, Fittings & Fixtures (FFF)
   - Stocks
   - Electrical Installations (E.I.)
2. **Database Storage**:

   - `pending_factory_insurance_details` table for pending policies

### Product Name Management
1. **Local Storage**: Product names stored locally on PC
2. **Dynamic Dropdown**: Shows existing + "Add New" option
3. **Smart Detection**: Automatically shows conditional fields based on product type
4. **No Database Impact**: Product names don't clutter the database

## ðŸ“‹ Database Schema Requirements

Before using the new features, run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add sum_insured columns
ALTER TABLE public.policies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_insured NUMERIC(12,2) NULL;
ALTER TABLE public.pending_policies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sum_insured NUMERIC(12,2) NULL;
```

Your existing schema already includes all the health and factory insurance tables, so no additional changes are needed.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### For Users:
1. **Product Selection**: Choose from dropdown or add new product type
2. **Conditional Fields**: 
   - Select "HEALTH INSURANCE" â†’ Health section appears
   - Select "FACTORY INSURANCE" â†’ Factory section appears
   - Other products â†’ Only general sum insured field
3. **Health Insurance**:
   - Choose Floater or Individual plan
   - Add multiple members with individual details
4. **Factory Insurance**:
   - Fill in coverage amounts for different categories

### For Developers:
1. **Product Detection**: JavaScript checks if product name contains "HEALTH" or "FACTORY"
2. **Form Validation**: Required fields are enforced based on product type
3. **Backend Processing**: Python routes handle the additional data appropriately
4. **Database Storage**: Related tables are populated automatically

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend (JavaScript):
- `ProductManager` class handles local storage
- Dynamic form sections show/hide based on product selection
- Member management with add/remove functionality

### Backend (Python):
- Form data extraction for health/factory specific fields

- Transfer logic for pending â†’ active policy conversion

### Database:
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Cascade deletes for data integrity

2. **Data Integrity**: Proper relational database structure
3. **Performance**: Local product caching, no unnecessary database calls
